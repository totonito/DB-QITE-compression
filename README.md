# DB-QITE-compression
Here is the code of my semester project made in the lab of Prof. Zoe Holmes with the supervision of Dr. Yudai Suzuki

The goal of this report is to implement the DB-QITE algorithm that prepares the ground state
of a generic hamiltonian following the DBQITE article of M. Gluza et
al. My contribution was to compress this algorithm to achieve the same performances with
a significant lower depth using the AQC_article.

### Files description
The articles used for this are `AQC_article.pdf` and `DBQITE.pdf`
The final report is found on `Report.pdf` with the datas of the figures available in `datas.py`
The code is available on `code.py` if you want to redo the computation
